    <p style="color: black; font-size: 20px ">Hell-raising, wheel-chasing, new worldly possessions
        Flesh-making, spirit-breaking, which one would you lessen?
        The better part, the human heart, you love 'em or dissect 'em
        Happiness or flashiness? How do you serve the question?
        See, in the perfect world, I would be perfect, world
        I don't trust people enough beyond their surface, world
        I don't love people enough to put my faith in man
        I put my faith in these lyrics, hoping I make a band
        I understand I ain't perfect, I probably won't come around
        This time, I might put you down
        Last time, I ain't give a f-, I still feel the same now
        My feelings might go numb
        You're dealing with cold thumb
        I'm willing to give up a leg and arm to show empathy from
        Pity parties and functions of you and yours
        A perfect world, you probably live another 24
        I can't fake humble just 'cause your a- is insecure
        I can't fake humble just 'cause your a- is insecure
        Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
        In another life, I surely was there
        Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
        I care, I care  </p>
